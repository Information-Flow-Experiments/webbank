This is a simple web banking application, designed to demonstrate a wide range
of Java application vulnerabilities. The functionality and implementation of
the application is intentionally contrived, and it is of no use except as an
aid to learning about Java security. It is based on a "Spring by Example"
sample application.

To build:

mvn clean package

To run with embedded jetty:

mvn jetty:run
