webbank
=======

This is a simple web banking application, designed to demonstrate a wide range of Java application vulnerabilities. It is based on a "Spring by Example" sample application. The functionality and implementation of the application is intentionally contrived, and it is of no use except as an aid to learning about Java security. It is used by the "Penetrating testing Java applications for fun and profit" training course. For more details, see [http://www.javapentesting.com/](http://www.javapentesting.com/)
